# Writing Plans

Write comprehensive implementation plans assuming the reader has zero context.

## Plan Location

Save plans to: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`

## Bite-Sized Task Granularity

**Each step is one action:**
- "Write the failing test" - step
- "Run it to make sure it fails" - step
- "Implement minimal code" - step
- "Run tests to verify pass" - step
- "Commit" - step

## Plan Document Header

**Every plan MUST start with:**

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]

**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]

**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies]

---
```

## Task Structure

```markdown
### Task N: [Component Name]

**Files:**
- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`
- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`
- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`

**Step 1: Write the failing test**

[Code block with complete test]

**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: FAIL with "function not defined"

**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**

[Code block with complete implementation]

**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**

Run: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`
Expected: PASS

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py
git commit -m "feat: add specific feature"
```
```

## Remember

- Exact file paths always
- Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
- Exact commands with expected output
- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits

## Execution Handoff

After saving the plan:

**"Plan complete and saved. Two execution options:**

1. **Subagent-Driven** - Fresh subagent per task, review between tasks
2. **Batch Execution** - Execute in batches with checkpoints

**Which approach?"**
